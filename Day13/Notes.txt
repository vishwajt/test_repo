--> Version Control System
    We are two type of VCS - CVCS and DVCS
    - In centralized we have to be connected to the network
    - In distributed we dont need to be connected all the time
    - Centralized is volatile and distributed it safer

--> Branches 
    - It helps to manage all the features or the code of a particular project
    - Master is one of the important brach that is the clean an testable code

--> If you create a file in the local repo and did not commit yet it will show 
    - error Untracked files:
            (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
                test.py
            nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

--> Stagaing area
    It is the area where untracked file is converted to tracked area
    It is cached in between local and the git
    Using git add cmd we can make the untracked to tracked
    This does not mean it is committed

--> After performing git commit will not submit the files to the github yet
